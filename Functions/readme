Assignments

Learning Objectives:
• Understand basic data types (numbers, strings) in TypeScript.
• Explore operators (assignment, arithmetic, comparison).
• Learn control flow statements (if/else, switch).
• Implement functions to reuse code.
• Introduce anonymous functions (function expressions).
• Understand anonymous functions.

Tasks:

                                 
1. Miles-to-Kilometers Converter (Operators):
• Create a variable named miles and assign a numeric value representing distance in miles.
• Calculate the equivalent distance in kilometers using the conversion factor (1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers). You can achieve this by multiplying miles by 1.60934.
• Store the converted distance in kilometers in a variable named kilometers.
• Use console.log to print a message in the following format:
The distance of 130 kms is equal to 209.2142 miles

                                 
2.Evaluating a number game:
• Prompt the user to enter a number.
• Compare the entered number with a dynamic number value.
• Output the result indicating whether the entered number is greater than, equal to, or less than the dynamic number value.

                                 
3.Friend checker game:
• Prompt the user to enter a name.
• Use a switch statement to check if the entered name is a known friend.
• Output a confirmation message if the name is known, otherwise output a default response.

                                 
4.Functions:
• Set up two different variables with different values.
• Call a function with these variables as arguments and output the result using console.log.
• Create a second call to the function with two more numbers as arguments.

                                 
3.Calculator project using function:
• Set up two variables containing number values.
• Set up a variable to hold an operator (+ or -).
• Create a function that takes two numbers and an operator as parameters, performs the corresponding operation, and returns the result.
• Call the function with the variables and operator, and output the result using console.log.
• Update the operator value and call the function again with the updated arguments.


4.Anonymous functions:
• Assign a function expression to a variable, with one parameter that outputs the provided argument to the console.
• Pass an argument into the function.
• Create the same function as a normal function declaration.
